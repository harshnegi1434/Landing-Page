				<h1>RED DEAD REDEMPTION II</h1>
				<p>
					America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery
					goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and
					the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the
					best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang
					must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of
					America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten
					to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own
					ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.

				"It's a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that's patient, polished,
				and a huge amount of fun to play, and it's combined with Rockstar's best
				storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can't
				wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a
				meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one
				of this generation's very best single-player action experiences? Here's
				your huckleberry."

				"This is a story - a collection of stories, really - about the decline
				of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun
				the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and
				lawmen they have antagonised along the way...There can be no doubt that
				this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video
				game worlds..."
